						The Inquiry & Innovation Program {"(i2)"} is a four-year leadership
						and enrichment program that challenges students to inquire how their
						capabilities and passions can serve communities from the local to
						global scale and to explore innovative ways to do so effectively.The
						i2 Program develops students problem-solving, creativity, analytical
						abilities, and leadership skills through a curriculum that
						integrates STEM, liberal arts, and service. Through annual projects,
						field trips, talks, performances, and outdoor adventures, students
						examine and address ideas and issues outside the classroom. As they
						involve themselves in the many programs at SHC, including Robotics,
						the Student Launch Initiative, and TEDxYouth@SHC, i2 students build
						their capacity to create positive change in the world.
